Problem variable notes:

MSSubClass: Actually a factor -- denotes what 'type' of housing it is
LotFrontage: Lots of NAs, could they be zeros for units not connected to the street? Check the MSSubClass
Alley: NAs should be refactored as 0, then gravel and paved as 1,2
Utilities: There's only 1 place without all utilities - probably drop this column
OverallQual & OverallCond: 1-10 scale, should be interpreted as numeric to gauge the scale
YearBuilt: If interpreted as numeric, then it is a guage of newness. Could try grouping to see if certain eras are different. Probably don't want to factor each individual year. 
YearRemodAdd: Could derive a variable for 'HasBeenRemodeled' if YearRemodAdd == YearBuilt or subtract them to model well maintained old houses
RoofMatl: Very few that are not CompShg -> probably drop
MasVnrType & MasVnrArea: 8 NA's for the same rows -> maybe drop these or ignore
ExterQual & ExterCond: Ordered rating, could change to integer
All Basement Variables: Replace NA's to indicate no basement, possibly change to integer to order
Heating: Almost all are Gas - probably drop
HeatingQC: Ordered - change to integer
Electrical: There's one NA?
X1stFlrSF, X2ndFlorSF: Derive how many floors using these and the basement value
LowQualFinSF: Most are zero, perhaps switch to a factor or drop
Bathroom Vars: Combine to produce a single bathroom number potentially
BedroomAbvGr: There are some a few zero bedrooms - check those rows
KitchenQual: Turn into ordered integer
Functional: Perhaps only include functional houses in a pricing model 
FireplaceQu: NA's for no fireplace - replace with a zero and make this an ordered integer
GarageVariables: NA's instead of No Garage
GarageQual, GarageCond: Turn into a numeric ordered var
Pool Variables: Pretty much no samples with pools, probably drop them
Fence: NA's need to be refactored as 0's
Misc: This is basically a shed or no shed variable, there's 2 others 2 2nd garages and 1 tennis court, could probably just keep MiscVal variable
