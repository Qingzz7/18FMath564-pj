Exploring the effect of different aspects of residential homes on price and predicting the price of houses in Ames, Iowa

1. Problem description
Most people understand and accept the risk that stock prices might fall, but when they buy a house, they might never think that the price of house will decrease. Many house buyers use recent price performance as a benchmark for what they expect over the next several years. While recent house price performance is generally not a good prediction of future house price performance1. The housing market is subject to the same forces of supply and demand as any other market. There are more factors that affect the house price rather than the number of bedrooms or a white picket fence. In this paper, we explore almost every aspects of house in determining the house price. We perform the linear regression techniques to predict the house price, evaluate models and choose the best regression model.
